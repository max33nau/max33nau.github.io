          <h6>What is Bewander?</h6>
          <p>
            Bewander is a fresh social media website that was created to connect travelers to the best way to see the world on whatever budget. 
            It strives to be a trusted source of reviews created by like-minded travelers and help travelers network while abroad. 
            When you go somewhere new, you tend to ask your friends what they thought if they’ve been here. That’s what Bewander is. 
            A place for you to get traveling advice you can rely on - without a vested interest.

          <h6>Did I build Bewander from scratch?</h6>
          <p>
            <strong>No</strong>, when I was completing my course at Tech Academy (a bootcamp style coding course) we were given an existing project to
            work on. We basically treated the project as if we were working for a Client and a Product Owner that had a backlog of tasks we were supposed to 
            complete. At Tech Academy, they want your final project to feel like a real job experience, so we were put in a scrum type atmosphere where we
            completed two sprints worth of work. We would assign ourselves tasks from the backlog and have a daily standup each day to discuss our progress.

            Please not that I do not manage this site and they are constantly having new developers work on the project. So things may have changed
            since the last time I worked on this project or they may have not even rolled out the features I implemented yet. If you would like to 
            see my changes you can view the before and after pictures/descriptions below.
